MultiTypeTree
=============

This is a BEAST 2 package which allows for the inference of multi-type
or structured phylogenetic trees.  It includes a full set of proposal
operators and currently the structured coalescent model, allowing
migration rates and sub-population sizes to be inferred from
serially-sampled sequence data.  The multi-type trees and the
operators contained in this package can also be used as the basis for
structured population inference under other models.

For further information, please refer to the MultiTypeTree [web
page](http://tgvaughan.github.io/MultiTypeTree).
